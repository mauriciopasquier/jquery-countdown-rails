# jquery-countdown-rails

[jquery-countdown][] for the asset pipeline. Despite the name, it works fine if
you're using [sprockets][] without rails.

## This gem is not maintained anymore

You should instead use something like [rails-assets][] or through `yarn` and
`webpack` if you're using rails 5.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'jquery-countdown-rails'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jquery-countdown-rails

This gem's version reflects the asset version starting with `1.6.3`.

## Usage

Require the core file, and any locale you need, in your `application.js` (`-en`
is already in the core file by default)

    //= require jquery.countdown
    //= require jquery.countdown-es

And default styles in your `application.css`

    *= require jquery.countdown
